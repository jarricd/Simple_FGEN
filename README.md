# Simple_FGEN
A simple WIP project aiming to create simple hardware square wave generator using VHDL.


The aim is to create square wave generator for testing with different predefined frequencies, to help me test valorious devices.

Everything is controlled by dip switches, but it can be any input, like button or so. For testing and debugging I'm using switches 
built-in to Terasic DE0 board.

Frequency will be displayed on 4 hex displays, but in future I will be using a 16x2 text display.

Documentation WIP.
